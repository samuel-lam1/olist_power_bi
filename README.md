# olist Performance Analysis
<li>The dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce">Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist</a> was used</li>
<li>Sellers' performance during Fiscal Year 2017 (1st Sep 2016 – 31st Aug 2017) and 2018 (1st Sep 2017 – 31st Aug 2018) was analysed</li>
<li>The following sections share the identified insights and provide recommendations to improve olist's revenue generated by their sellers</li>
<li>You may refer to the <a href="https://github.com/samuel-lam1/olist_power_bi/blob/main/olist%20seller%20performance%20analysis.pdf">olist seller performance analysis.pdf</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/samuel-lam1/olist_power_bi/blob/main/olist%20sellers%20sales%20report%20(Power%20BI).pdf">olist sellers sales report (Power BI).pdf</a> for more details</li>

### Seller total sales

<li>These figures represent the fiscal years 2017 and 2018 of the 5 regions and 27 states in the country</li>
<li>Total sales were $R 13.6M, driven by the contributions of 3,905 sellers</li>
<li>The Southeast region, and the São Paulo state which is also in this region, were the major contributors to the total sales. With nearly 80% and 60% of all sellers, they contributed respectively 78.7% and 64.8% of the total sales</li>
<br>

### Seller average sales

<li>For average sales per seller, as observed in the bar charts, the Northeast region, and the top 3 states Maranhão, Bahia, and Pernambuco, which are all in the Northeast region, outperformed Southeast and São Paulo respectively by impressive margins ranging from 79.7% to at most 666%</li>
<li>This difference suggests the presence of potential high-quality sellers in these areas, revealing significant business opportunities for olist to establish connections and partnerships with them</li>
<br>

### Seller sales growth
![Seller sales growth](https://github.com/samuel-lam1/olist_power_bi/blob/ppt_slide/ppt_slide_5.jpg?raw=true)
<li>Moving on to the sales growth, the Northeast region stands out with a remarkable 419% growth</li>
<li>Among the states, Mato Grosso, Pernambuco, and Sergipe were on the top list, with Mato Grosso exhibited an outstanding growth rate of nearly 6000%</li>
<li>This highlights another significant business opportunity for olist to enhance seller partnerships in these locations, thereby driving increased sales</li>
<li>In addition, we observed 4 states without any sellers, which were Roraima, Amapá, Tocantins, and Alagoas, in the North and Northeast regions</li>

#### Recommedations
<li>It is recommended that olist expand its business coverage geographically in areas with high average sales and growth rates but low number of sellers, such as the <em>North</em> and <em>Northeast</em> regions, and the highlighted states <em>Maranhão, Bahia, Pernambuco, Mato Grosso, and Sergipe</em></li>
<li>olist should also explore the feasibility of partnering with sellers in the 4 states without seller (<em>Roraima, Amapá, Tocantins, and Alagoas</em>)</li>
<li>Providing attractive partnering packages and support resources to new sellers in the above highlighted locations can contribute to the diversification and expansion of our seller base.</li>

### Seller partnership

<li>Moving to the seller partnership, the partnership durations in the dataset are ranging from 0 to over 700 days</li>
<li>Correlations are identified between the partnership duration and the total sales, as well as the amount of orders</li>
<li>The longer the duration, the greater the sales and the order amounts</li>
<li>It follows a logarithmic pattern, which suggests that longer durations lead to more significant growth</li>

#### Recommedations
<li>olist can focus on fostering and building long-term partnership with sellers</li>
<li>For example, implement <em>performance-based incentives and rewards</em>, such as <em>tiered commission rates</em>, for top-performing sellers to motivate their continuous improvements</li>
<li>Some other incentives would be <em>badges system</em> and <em>marketing exposure opportunities</em>. This can increase seller public recognition and visibility, and potentially attract more customers to their stores, which can be another powerful motivator</li>
<li>Another suggestion could be to develop <em>loyalty schemes</em> or <em>exclusive benefits</em> for sellers with long-standing partnerships</li>
<li>For example, provide <em>discounts</em> on using olist platform such as reduced listing fees, subscription fees, or any other charges associated with the platform</li>
<li>olist can also offer <em>priority support service</em> for loyal sellers. This ensures that they receive swift assistance which can strengthen positive relationships</li>
