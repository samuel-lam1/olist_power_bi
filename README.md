<li>These figures represent the fiscal years 2017 and 2018 of the 5 regions and 27 states in the country</li>
<li>Total sales were $R 13.6M, driven by the contributions of 3,905 sellers</li>
<li>The Southeast region, and the São Paulo state which is also in this region, were the major contributors to the total sales. With nearly 80% and 60% of all sellers, they contributed respectively 78.7% and 64.8% of the total sales</li>

<li>For average sales per seller, as observed in the bar charts, the Northeast region, and the top 3 states Maranhão, Bahia, and Pernambuco, which are all in the Northeast region, outperformed Southeast and São Paulo respectively by impressive margins ranging from 79.7% to at most 666%</li>
<li>This difference suggests the presence of potential high-quality sellers in these areas, revealing significant business opportunities for olist to establish connections and partnerships with them</li>
<br>

### Seller sales growth

<li>Moving on to the sales growth, the Northeast region stands out with a remarkable 419% growth</li>
<li>Among the states, Mato Grosso, Pernambuco, and Sergipe were on the top list, with Mato Grosso exhibited an outstanding growth rate of nearly 6000%</li>
<li>This highlights another significant business opportunity for olist to enhance seller partnerships in these locations, thereby driving increased sales</li>
<li>In addition, we observed 4 states without any sellers, which were Roraima, Amapá, Tocantins, and Alagoas, in the North and Northeast regions</li>

#### __Recommedations__
<li>It is recommended that olist expand its business coverage geographically in areas with high average sales and growth rates but low number of sellers, such as the <strong>North</strong> and <strong>Northeast</strong> regions, and the highlighted states <strong>Maranhão, Bahia, Pernambuco, Mato Grosso, and Sergipe</strong></li>
<li>olist should also explore the feasibility of partnering with sellers in the 4 states without seller (<strong>Roraima, Amapá, Tocantins, and Alagoas</strong>)</li>
<li>Providing attractive partnering packages and support resources to new sellers in the above highlighted locations can contribute to the diversification and expansion of our seller base.</li>
